# Identification-of-Novel-Biomarkers-for-Early-Detection

This final project report focuses on the early detection of cancer by identifying novel biomarkers using bioinformatics methods. 

The project's goal is to address the challenge of late-stage cancer diagnosis by using a 3-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the presence or absence of a genetic biomarker called MGMT promoter methylation in brain tumors from MRI scans.

Programming Language used: Python
